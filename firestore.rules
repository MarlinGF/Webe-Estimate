/**
 * @fileOverview This ruleset enforces a strict user-ownership model for client-related data
 * stored under `/users/{userId}`. Services and parts are globally accessible.
 *
 * Data Structure:
 * - `/users/{userId}/clients/{clientId}`: Stores client information, owned by the specified user.
 * - `/users/{userId}/clients/{clientId}/estimates/{estimateId}`: Stores estimates for a client, owned by the specified user.
 * - `/users/{userId}/clients/{clientId}/estimates/{estimateId}/invoices/{invoiceId}`: Stores invoices for an estimate, owned by the specified user.
 * - `/users/{userId}/clients/{clientId}/estimates/{estimateId}/lineItems/{lineItemId}`: Stores line items for an estimate, owned by the specified user.
 * - `/services/{serviceId}`: Stores publicly accessible service information.
 * - `/parts/{partId}`: Stores publicly accessible part information.
 *
 * Key Security Decisions:
 * - Clients, estimates, invoices, and line items are strictly owned by the user ID in the path.
 * - Listing of clients, estimates, invoices, and line items is only allowed for the owner.
 * - Services and parts are publicly readable.  Write access to these collections is not defined and should be secured appropriately in a production environment.
 *
 * Denormalization for Authorization:
 * -  The `clientId`, `estimateId`, and `invoiceId` are denormalized into subcollection documents to avoid costly `get()` calls in security rules.
 *
 * Structural Segregation:
 * - User-specific data (clients, estimates, invoices, line items) is stored under `/users/{userId}`.
 * - Public data (services, parts) is stored in top-level collections.
